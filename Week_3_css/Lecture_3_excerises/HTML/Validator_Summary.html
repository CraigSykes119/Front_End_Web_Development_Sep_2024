</head>
<body>
<p>Was the CSS validator easy to use? Did anything surprise you? </p> 
<p>Yes I thought it was easy to use. I have used it before and always use the direct input method. I find it good as final checks before any piece of code goes into production.</p>


<p>Did you encounter a number of errors or just a few?</p>
<p> I didnt encounter any, but I have previously and the feedback is usually helpful.</p>    
    
<p>How easy was it to determine how to correct the CSS file?</p>
<p>I didn't have any errors but previously, I have found the colour codes for the serinouss of the error helpful</p> 
    
<p>Would you recommend the validator to other students? Why or why not?</p>
<p>Yes I would, it a good way to ensure you did not miss any errors.</p>
