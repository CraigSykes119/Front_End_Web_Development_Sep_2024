    <h1>Information Architecture </h1>
    <p>The website I have chosen is <a href="https://greenesrestaurant.com/">Grennes Restaurant</a></p>

    <question> Who are the typical users of the website (2-3 max). Give a short description of each.</question>
    <answer> 
        <ul>
            <li>People in nearby area looking for somewhere to eat / book a table</li>
            <li>Already booked customers who are looking for information on menu or address</li>
            <li>People seeking to purchase a gift voucher for someone else to use</li>
        </ul> 
    </answer>
    <question>Organization system</question>
    <answer>The organisation seems to be a call to action overlaying a hero image to book a table. This is paired with a CTA to purchase a voucher in the top right hand corner. There is a burger menu icon with just one option named underneath which seems strange. The content below the fold seems to be heavily menu based.  </answer>
    <question>Labelling system</question>
    <answer>The labeling system seems to be clear. Each CTA is clear what clicking it will do however there is not a lot of depth to the website, therefore the labels are self explanotory.  </answer>
    <question>Navigation system
        <ul>
        <li>Header design and main site navigation (both desktop and mobile)</li>
        <li>Footer design</li>
        </ul>
    </question>
    <answer> Navigation is poor as there is not a lot to choose from. There is a sticky menu on the left in desktop but it i easily missed as the user would intiuiively look at the header for navigation. on Mobile, the voucher CTA is moved into the burger menu but doesn't look right as it follows a differest deign than the other option.</answer>
    <answer> The footer is quite large in size and contains alot of information such as number, opening hours, address but is not formatted correctly, and seems to skew on desktop. It is also not fit for mobile as sme of the text is cut off on a smaller screen.
    <question>Searching system  </question>>
    <answer> There is no search present on the website</answer>
    <question>Top Tasks & User Flows
        <li>What are the top tasks (max 5) for the website?</li>
        <li>How well would you rate the design in relation to these tasks?</li>
        <li>Identify any major issues</li>
        </ul>
    </question>
    <answer>Top tasks for this site is
        <ul>
            <li>Get users to book a table</li>
            <li>Get users to purchase a voucher</li>
            <li>Provide information on menu, wine and suppliers</li>
            <li>give information on how to contact the business</li>
        </ul> 
    </answer>
    <answer> The IA makes sense however there is not a clean way to navigate to all of this info.</answer>
    <answer> Formatting in the footer is not great, the hero image at the top is too big and the dropdown menu on mobile does not have enough option. there also seems to be 2 navigation menus, 1 at the top and another at the side on desktop.</answer>
    <question>Overall page design and layout</question>
    <answer> The overall layout is basic howeber the flow of information is appropiate for the tasks which it is trying to complete.</answer>
